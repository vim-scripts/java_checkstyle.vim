Description
-----------
The java_checkstyle.vim filetype plugin script integrates Checkstyle
<http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/> with Vim.  "Checkstyle is a
development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a
coding standard" (from the Checkstyle home page).  This plugin allows a
user to run Checkstyle on the current Java file, putting the results in an
errorfile and jumping to the first Checkstyle error.

Dependencies
------------
In addition to the scripts that come bundled with the plugin, there are
several external dependencies, including:

    Checkstyle <http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/> - this script was
        written against version 2.4.
    xsltproc from libxslt <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>
    libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/> (used by libxslt)
    mktemp <http://www.mktemp.org/>

Installation
------------
The two scripts (checkstyle and vimcheckstyle) should be copied to
someplace in the PATH.  By default, the java_checkstyle.vim will look for
vimcheckstyle in /usr/local/bin.  The XSLT stylesheet
(checkstyle-quickfix.xsl) should be copied to /usr/local/lib; if you
prefer, you may put it in a different location, but you will also need to
edit the vimcheckstyle script to reflect that location.  If you have
Checkstyle installed in a location other than /opt/checkstyle, you will
need to edit the checkstyle script to reflect that location.  On UNIX, the
java_checkstyle.vim script should be copied to the ~/.vim/ftplugin
directory (see :help ftplugins for more information).  If you have not
already done so, you will also need to turn on filetype plugin usage in
Vim using the following command (you will probably want to put this in
your .vimrc):

    :filetype plugin on

Usage
-----
java_checkstyle.vim is a filetype plugin for Java files that introduces the
following command:

:Checkstyle - runs Checkstyle <http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/> on the
              current file and opens the results in an errorfile

In order to use the command, simply edit a Java file and then execute
:Checkstyle.  You should jump to the first Checkstyle error.  You can move
through the remain errors using the standard QuickFix commands (see :help
quickfix for more information).

Platforms
---------
This script has been developed on Linux, but through Cygwin
<http://www.cygwin.com/>, all the required tools should be available on
Windows.  I would appreciate any feedback that would enhance the script's
ability to be used on these and other systems.
